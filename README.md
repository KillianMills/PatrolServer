This project is a system that allows users to automatically report problems with a road such as potholes in the background while they are driving.

The primary aim of this project is to have an android device record how much it wobbles while the user has activated it, if there are sharp spikes across the majority of users the road will be given a warning for future users to try and avoid. This warning will only be removed when the city council has fixed the problem and the road is back to itâ€™s acceptable quality.
